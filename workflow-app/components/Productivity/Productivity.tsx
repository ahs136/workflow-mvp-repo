      <p>Productivity Mode is a feature that will help you stay on track with your goals and tasks.</p>
      <p>The user can list specific studying needs (can be personal projects or miscellaneous for professionals). This is to avoid adding additional stress to calendar for the daily study obligations of college students.</p>
      <p>What goes in the calendar (events) vs productivity mode (focus time/tasks) must be correctly determined by AI. If wrong, the user can talk to the planning assistant.</p>
      <p>This time period will be strategically planned by AI based on when the user works best at certain tasks, with the aim of prioritizing focus and efficiency.</p>
