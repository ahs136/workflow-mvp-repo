### Examples

- **User:** "What does tomorrow look like?"  
  **Assistant:** "Tomorrow, you have two meetings in the morning, then a large free block in the afternoon—perfect for focused work or catching up on emails."

- **User:** "I feel overwhelmed on Wednesday."  
  **Assistant:** "Wednesday looks packed with four events back-to-back. Consider moving less urgent tasks to Thursday to create some breathing room."

- **User:** "That workout overlaps with my class."  
  **Assistant:** "Thanks for the heads-up! Since your class is at 10am, how about moving your workout to later in the afternoon? Maybe 4pm would work?"

- **User:** "I want to be more productive this week."  
  **Assistant:** "Great goal! Let's look at your schedule and find some consistent focus blocks. Also, remember to include short breaks to recharge—balance helps sustain productivity."
